Title: helper functions for data processing and analysis for the Mian soybean breeding group. 
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Jay Gillenwater
Description: This package is a collection of functions that are meant to help with common data processing
    and analysis tasks that come up during our soybean breeding program. Most of the functions help with
    cleaning up data from the files we use for data entry and wrangling them into formats that make downstream analysis
    much easier. Beyone this, there are a couple functions for detecting common errors, some for visualization, 
    and some for routine analysis and reporting.
